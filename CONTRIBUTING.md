# Research Contributing Guidelines

1. Communication: The first step in contributing is to get in touch with the project team. You can start by opening an issue or sending an email to the project maintainer. This will help you understand the goals of the project and how you can contribute.

2. Code of Conduct: Make sure to familiarize yourself with the project's code of conduct. This outlines the behavior that is expected of contributors and helps to create a positive and inclusive environment.

3. Fork the Repository: Create a personal copy of the repository by forking it. This allows you to make changes and submit a pull request for review.

4. Branching: When making changes, create a new branch from the main repository. This helps to keep your changes organized and separate from other work being done on the project.

5. Commit Messages: Use clear and concise commit messages to describe your changes. This makes it easier for others to understand what you've done and why.

6. Pull Request: Submit a pull request to the main repository when you're ready. Be sure to include a detailed description of your changes and any relevant issues or discussions.

7. Review Process: The project team will review your contribution and provide feedback. Make sure to address any comments or concerns in a timely manner.

8. Finalizing Your Contribution: Once your changes have been accepted, they will be merged into the main repository. Congratulations! You've just made a contribution to research.

9. Remember that contributing to research is a collaborative effort, so be patient and open to feedback. The goal is to create the best possible outcome for the project and the community.
